/*MVC Notes:
	https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-design/model-view-controller-explained/
		Summary:
		Model View and Controller work best when seperated
		Model		- holds data
		View		- loads data independently of the Model
		Controller	- provides model data to view, also performs operations on the data
