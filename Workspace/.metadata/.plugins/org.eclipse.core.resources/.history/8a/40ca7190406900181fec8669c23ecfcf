/*MVC Notes:
https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-design/model-view-controller-explained/
	Summary:
	Model View and Controller work best when separated
	Model		- holds data
	View		- loads data independently of the Model
	Controller	- provides model data to view, also performs operations on the data
