Phase 3 Development
	06-11-2018
		Alex
		Fixed Ali's buggy XMLwriter (45 minutes)
			Had to re-do each function he wrote
			His function calls were mispelled and un-commented
			Had to re-code loop iterations inside functions because they used the wrong data type
			Had to rename methods that used wrong data types
			
		Added comments to Ali's XMLwriter, there were none
		
		Meshed my GUI to use my reworked version of whatever Ali posted (5 mins)
